# To Do List App
This app was created to demonstrate my ability to develop a CRUD app featuring:
- React
- Express
- PosgreSQL
- Heroku Deployment

# So, what's the purpose of this app?
Well, in case you didn't read the title, this is a To Do List! You are able to create, check off, and delete tasks. If you makea typo -- you can even edit it. Simple enough, right?
